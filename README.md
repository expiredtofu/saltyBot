saltyBot
========

This bot places virtual bets on the site http://www.saltybet.com/

As this has not been updated since January, the site the bot works on may have changed, rendering the bot useless. However, it is still useful as an example of a python bot that utilizes the [Selenium Webdriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/), as well as pickle for the storing of cookies and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) for the storing of player data.

To run this script, simply download [main.py](main.py) (and make sure you have the required packages). [sort.py](sort.py) gets the hdf5 file and displays the rankings of all players in descending order.  Inside the [data](data/) folder are an image depicting the account's virtual currency over a period of almost 9000 bets, and the rankings the bot accumulated over that time.
